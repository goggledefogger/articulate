# Articulate

#### Communicate by touch instead of speaking

## Features

- click/tap any of 5 choice categories to choose what you want to say
- each choice can lead to the next level of choices in that category
- edit or add as many choices and levels deep as you want
- smooth lengthy transitions so extra touches won't affect the selection
- wide margins between choices so it's easier to touch the one you want
- works on any device as a webpage

## How To Run

Ready to go as a static website, just use the `public` directory as the root and start with `index.html`

To develop use `npm run dev` which will help with building and running a dev http server.

## Future feature ideas

- Speak the words out of the speaker
- Show images of the choices
